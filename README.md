# Acer A515-51 Hackintosh

This Hackintosh currently runs on macOS Catalina 10.15.7 and OpenCore 0.6.2

This repo includes all necessary files to get up and running with OpenCore on an Acer A515-51 Laptop (and likely any other with similar specifications).

What works:<br>
☑️ iServices<br>
☑️ Power Management<br>
☑️ DRM<br>
☑️ PS2 Touchpad<br>
☑️ Screen Brightness<br>
☑️ Sleep<br>
☑️ USB<br>
☑️ Probably much more that I can't think of right now

What doesn't work:<br>
❌ Battery Readout<br>
❌ I2C Touchpad<br>
❌ Card Reader<br>
