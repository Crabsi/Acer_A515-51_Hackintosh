# Acer A515-51 Hackintosh

This Hackintosh currently runs on macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 and OpenCore 0.6.3.

This repo includes all necessary files to get up and running with OpenCore on an Acer A515-51 Laptop (and likely any other with similar specifications).

What works:<br>
✔️ iServices<br>
✔️ Power Management<br>
✔️ DRM<br>
✔️ PS2 Touchpad<br>
✔️ I2C Touchpad<br>
✔️ Screen Brightness<br>
✔️ Sleep<br>
✔️ USB<br>
✔️ Battery Readout<br>
✔️ Probably much more that I can't think of right now<br>
✔️ WiFi, Bluetooth, Handoff, Sidecar etc. (only because I replaced the Atheros card with a natively supported BCM94360NG card.)

What doesn't work:<br>
❌ Brightness Function Keys (are not in the right place)<br>
❌ SD-Card Reader
